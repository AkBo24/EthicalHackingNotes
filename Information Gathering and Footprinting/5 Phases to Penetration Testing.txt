1. Footprinting/Reconnaissance: gather data of the host machine to be attacked
    direct : hacker can send information (packets) to the host machine
    passive: gather information through publicly available information (like search engines) 
    Kali tools: theHarvester (https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/theharvester)

2. Scanning/Enumeration: Use scanners to detect if the machine is vulnerable to attacks
    Kali Tools: nmap (https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/nmap)
    
3. Exploitation: using a vulnerable machine to launch an attack
    Kali Tools: âˆ†s based on the type of attack
    
4. Maintain Access: use the machine to continue attacking the network

5. Cover Up Tracks: get rid of digital footprint
